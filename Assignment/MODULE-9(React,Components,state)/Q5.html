    <h1>Q5.What is Components in React Js?</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Ans.</strong>Components are independent and reusable bits of code.
      They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation
      and return HTML. Components come in two types, Class components and
      Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function
      components.
