    <h1>Q1.What is React Js?</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Ans.</strong>ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library used to
      create user interfaces in a declarative and efficient way. It is a
      component-based front-end library responsible only for the view layer of a
      Model View Controller(MVC) architecture. React is used to create modular
      user interfaces and promotes the development of reusable UI components
      that display dynamic data.
