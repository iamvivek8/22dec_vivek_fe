    <h1>Q9.How to change in components of React Js?</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Ans.</strong> setState() enqueues changes to the component state
      and tells React that this component and its children need to be
      re-rendered with the updated state. This is the primary method you use to
      update the user interface in response to event handlers and server
      responses.
